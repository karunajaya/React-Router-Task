        Data science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting meaningful insights and knowledge from large volumes of data. It combines elements of statistics, computer science, and domain-specific expertise to analyze and interpret complex datasets. By leveraging techniques like machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics, data scientists can identify patterns, trends, and relationships that help organizations make informed decisions. The role of a data scientist involves not only collecting and cleaning data but also developing models to forecast outcomes, optimize processes, and drive innovation across industries such as healthcare, finance, and technology.
